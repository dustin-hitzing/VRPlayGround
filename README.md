# VRPlayGround

## Welcome to VR

In order to get this to work you need to have unity version 2018.3.0b1

The SampleScene in the scenes folder needs to have its build settings changed to UWP and its player settings need to have XR settings set to VR Enabled.

The 2DTestScene needs to be built with the Windows, Mac, Linux stand alone setting in the build settings window.
